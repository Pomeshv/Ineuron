   * Intuitive Interface: Power-BI boasts an Intuitive user interface that empowers both technical and non-technical analyst.
   * Drag-and-drop Functionality: Analysts can build data visualizations and analyses efficiency without requiring extensive coding skills.
   * Self-Service Analytics: Instead of relying solely on central data teams,Power-Bi enables staff to access data quickly and answer business questions independently.

2. Democratization of Data Insights:
 
   * Dashboards: Power-BI allows analysts to create interactive dashboards that provide real time insights across the organization.
   * Connect and Transform Data: Analysts can connect to various data sources and use advanced data preparation capabilities to transform data for analysis.
   * Visualization: The tool facilitates the creation of rich visualizations,making it easier to spot trends and identify critical information.
   
3. Advanced Data Visualization: 
   
   * Tell Data Stories: Analysts can use Power BI to tell compelling data stories through advanced visualization. Charts,graphs, and other visual elements help convey insights effectively.

Q.3.Explain Descriptive analytics?
A.3. It Answers the question of what happend.
     Summarize past data usually in the form of dashboards.
     Insights into past.
     Also known as Statistical analysis.
     Raw data from multiple data sources.
Descriptive analytics is the process of using current and historical data to identify 
trends and relationships. It's often considered the simplest form of data analysis because it describes patterns and relationships without without delving deeper into casually or prediction.

 Techniques: 
            Descriptive Stastistics - histogram, correlation
            Data Visualization
            Exploratory Data Analysis[Seaborn Library in Python]
         
Q.4.Explain Predictive analytics?
A.4.It Answers the question of what is likely to happen.
Predict the Future trends.
Being able to predict allows one to make better decisions.
Analysis based on machine or deep learning.
Accuracy of the forecasting or prediction highly depends on data quality and stability of the situation.

*Examples of predictive analysis is:
 Moonsoon Forecast ,Covid Patient Discharge Prediction.

 *Predictive analysis Techniques/Algorithms: 
 Regression
 Classification
 ML algorithms like Linear regression
 Logistic regression,SVM
 Deep Learning techniques

Q.5.Explain perspective analytics?
A.5.Answers the question of what might happen.
