Bridge Monitoring System,"Dec 12, 2016","Bridge monitoring system is significant to health diagnosis of bridges and flyovers. This report is proposed and developed a novel architecture for large span bridge monitoring.  A 3-level distributed structure is adopted in the monitoring system, which includes central server, intelligent acquisition node and local controller.  Acquisition nodes are located across the bridge. One local controller manages all the acquisition nodes. Every acquisition node has 8 channels, which can sample displacement, acceleration and strain of bridge.  To get high precision data, a 10 bits A/D converter. Compare to the traditional method, the proposed architecture has two features. First, the acquisition node is a smart device based on powerful DSP processor.  Signals of field sensors are analyzed and real time compressed in the acquisition node. Only the processing results are sent to local controller through IEEE 802.11 wireless network. This operation can relieve load of central server and decrease demand of communication bandwidth.  Second, 2G wireless network is utilized to provide enough bandwidth for real-time data transmission between local controller and central server. The intelligent monitoring system has run on a large span bridge for six months. Running results show that the proposed system is stable and effective.",International Journal of Innovative Studies in Sciences and Engineering Technology (IJISSET),http://ijisset.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IJISSET-021222.pdf
