You need to work a lot on color combination.Thumb Rule is if you are using yellow/black/white background your charts and graph should be solid dark color to get that professional appeal …Check below one of the dashboard i recently reviewed from  Bhavana Joshi

1️⃣Title label use Mud Yellow color / black for that asthetic appeal for background
2️⃣Clear & Home button alignment and cards size is not up to the mark 
3️⃣Sort the product brand when you are showcasing on on the order of Profit Margin or whatever is the business problem you are trying to showcase
4️⃣Use preferably different color apart from green if you have white background. Best color for background is black/yellow/white while you can use other color for cards.Refer novypro.com for such detailing so that you hav e the complete picture
5️⃣Use the same formatting(color+font+size) for all the numbers and keep it white preferably (if black background)

I would explain that . These dashboards which you see they go to the market PRODUCTION side and at the end they use it be it for the MARKET/HIGHER MANAGEMENT folks who likes to see data in readable format and not in 3D visual effects after all it’s a number game in dashboard not a PAINTING CLASS 
.
.
~So never ever use any 3D effects in your visualisation .

~ Never use dark color in your visualisation except black/yellow/white/Grey.If you are using black background,have yellow tiles or blue or red.Avoid pink for sure 

~ Never use any grid lines for any of your chart be it line chart,bar-graph or any 
.
.
Follow above steps so that you can ace your interview even .This I am telling from my experince and after working on beyond 50+ BUSINESS dashboards . Hope I am enlightening the community…."
