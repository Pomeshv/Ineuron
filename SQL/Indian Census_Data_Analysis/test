ðŸŒŸ Excited to Share My SQL Project on Indian Census Data! ðŸŒŸ
Over the past few weeks, I delved into the Indian Census datasets to uncover insights on population growth, literacy rates, and gender ratios across states. Through various SQL queries, I analyzed trends, identified top-performing states, and visualized disparities in literacy and sex ratios.
Key Findings:
Top States in Literacy: Kerala and Lakshadweep lead with impressive literacy rates.
Population Insights: The total population of India stands at over 1.2 billion, with significant growth variations across states.
Gender Ratios: Notable disparities in sex ratios highlight areas for improvement.
This project not only honed my SQL skills but also deepened my understanding of demographic data analysis. Looking forward to applying these insights in real-world scenarios!
