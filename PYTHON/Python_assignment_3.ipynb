    "     1. Code Reusability: Function allow to write a piece of code once and reuseit anywhere in program. This can save time and effort.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     2. Modularity: Functions help to break down a large program into small, manageable parts. Each function performs a specific tasks. This makes the program easier to understand, debug, and maintain.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     3. Abstraction: Functions hide the completely of a task. You can use a function without knowing the details of how it accomplishes its task.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     4. Namespace Isolation: Variables defined inside a function are not visible outside. This helps to avoid variable name conflicts.\n",

    "     5. Testing and debugging: It's easier to test and debug small functions than a large program. If a problem occurs, You can isolate the function causing the issue and fix it.\n",
