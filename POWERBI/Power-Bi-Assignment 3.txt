    - **Central Individuals**:
        - These are the key players who hold significant influence, even if they don't have the highest authority or job titles.
        - Central individuals control valuable resources, information, or act as bridges between disconnected groups.
        - Identifying them is crucial for understanding power dynamics.
    - **Relationships and Influence**:
        - Power exists within relationships. It's not something owned but rather a function of how much control one has over resources valued by others.
        - Influence flows through connections, advice, and information exchange.
        - Power mapping helps you visualize these relationships.

3. **Why Is Power Mapping Important?**

    - **Navigating Politics**: By mapping out influential individuals, you can navigate organizational politics more effectively.
    - **Agency and Success**: When power is accessible to everyone (not just a select few), employees feel more agency in their work and contribute to the company's success.

4. **How to Build a Power Map**:
    - **Identify Central Individuals**:
        - Look beyond formal titles. Focus on those who control information flow, bridge gaps, or serve as advisors.
        - They may not be obvious leaders but play critical roles.
    - **Map Relationships**:
        - Connect central individuals with others they influence.
        - Understand who seeks advice from whom and who controls access to resources.
    - **Visualize the Network**:
        - Create a visual representation (diagram or chart) that shows the power dynamics.
        - Highlight central individuals and their connections.

In summary, power mapping helps you gain insights into who wields influence, how information flows, and how to navigate the complex web of power within your organization¹.
